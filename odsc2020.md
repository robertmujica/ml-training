Transfer learning
https://tfhub.dev/ =>
pre-trained models can be used for Transfer learning e.g. to "reuse feature extractions layers" of existing models and modify the neuro net "head" layers to classify the only classes we are interested in.
Domain adaptation is also possible with existing models
one of the beauty of Transfer learning is that you can use small training data with unknown classes and using existing models like  MobileNetV2 to do for example some object detections.
we can use https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard to visualize Tensorflow models.
you can use https://colab.research.google.com/ to run github code: https://github.com/robertmujica/odsc_sota
Ideally we need GPUs for Transfer learning. (smile)
